Traffic Sign Recognition is a basic, day by day task for self-driving cars. The recognition system processes a traffic sign image extracted from the road scene, classifying that sign into one of 43 categories. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was designed to classify traffic signs from natural images using the German Traffic Sign Dataset. The hidden layers were pooling (sub-sampling) operations which reduce dimensions of resulted frames. Furthermore, after each convolution, a non-linear function (called ReLU) was used to introduce to non-linearity to the model. At the very end, for classification, there is a softmax layer. It transforms results of the model to probabilities of a correct guess of each traffic sign index. It attained a maximum accuracy of 96%.
